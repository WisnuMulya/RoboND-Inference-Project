# RoboND Inference Project
This project  examines the inference performance of deep neural networks with different parameters: epoch and architecture. The models are trained using dataset that is collected by the Udacity’s Robotics Software Nanodegree team and then the inference performances are compared. The results are all within Udacity’s specification: minimum of 75% accuracy and maximum of 10ms inference time. The observation also suggests that the number of epochs and deep neural network architecture affects the performance of the inference process. Following the observation, another deep neural network is created using the similar parameters as the best performing network’s and then an inference is conducted on the model.
